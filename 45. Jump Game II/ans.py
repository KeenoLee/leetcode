# You are given a 0-indexed array of integers nums of length n. You are initially positioned at nums[0].

# Each element nums[i] represents the maximum length of a forward jump from index i. In other words, if you are at nums[i], you can jump to any nums[i + j] where:

# 0 <= j <= nums[i] and
# i + j < n
# Return the minimum number of jumps to reach nums[n - 1]. The test cases are generated such that you can reach nums[n - 1].

 

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [2,3,0,1,4]
# Output: 2
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= nums.length <= 104
# 0 <= nums[i] <= 1000
# It's guaranteed that you can reach nums[n - 1].

class Solution:
    def jump(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # The starting range of the first jump is [0, 0]
        answer, n = 0, len(nums)
        cur_end, cur_far = 0, 0
        
        for i in range(n - 1):
            # Update the farthest reachable index of this jump.
            cur_far = max(cur_far, i + nums[i])

            # If we finish the starting range of this jump,
            # Move on to the starting range of the next jump.
            if i == cur_end:
                answer += 1
                cur_end = cur_far
                
        return answer
